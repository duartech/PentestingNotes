There are three main ways of accessing these event logs within a Windows system:
	Event Viewer (GUI-based application)
	Wevtutil.exe (command-line tool)
	Get-WinEvent (PowerShell cmdlet)

wevtutil.exe
	wevtutil.exe /?
	wevtutil.exe COMMAND /?
	

Get-WinEvent >> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/Get-WinEvent?view=powershell-7.3&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.1
	Get all logs from a computer:
		Get-WinEvent -ListLog *

	Get event log providers and log names
		Get-WinEvent -ListProvider *

	Log filtering
		Get-WinEvent -LogName Application | Where-Object { $_.ProviderName -Match 'WLMS' }

	To filter, it is more efficient to use:
		Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
		  LogName='Application' 
		  ProviderName='WLMS' 
		}

	In which the syntax is @{ <name> = <value>; [<name> = <value> ] ...}

XPATH: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wes/consuming-events#xpath-10-limitations
	// The following query selects all events from the channel or log file where the severity level is less than or equal to 3 and the event occurred in the last 24 hour period. 
	XPath Query: *[System[(Level <= 3) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 86400000]]]

	Examples:
		Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/Provider[@Name="WLMS"] and */System/TimeCreated[@Name="SystemTime"]="2020-12-15T01:09:08.940277500Z"'

		Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath '*/EventData/Data[@Name="TargetUserName"]="Sam" and */System/EventID=4720'

		Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath '*/EventData/Data[@Name="TargetUserName"]="Sam" and */System/EventID=4724'
